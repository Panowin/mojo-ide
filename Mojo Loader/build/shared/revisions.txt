Version 0.0.1 Pre-Alpha

This is the first release of the Mojo IDE! It is intended as a preview and will likely contain many bugs. Since this is such an early build it also lacks many of the features that will be introduced in later versions. Some planned features include, real-time error checking, search/replace, templates (auto-fill), auto-complete, warnings for common mistakes, and extra awesome.

The IDE features right now include, Verilog syntax highlighting, Verilog auto-indent full code fix-fix-indent (ctrl+shift+f), basic project creation/manipulation, integration with PlanAhead for building your project, integration with the Mojo Loader to load the generated bin file.
